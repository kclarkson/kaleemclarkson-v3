lead: When it comes to selling, leading, and performing in today's increasingly automated world, your personal energy is your ultimate differentiator.
content: "For years, offices were treated as a shortcut for culture. Put everyone in the same building and relationships will take care of themselves. Remote work removed that shortcut and exposed a hard truth. Most organizations never had a real social connection strategy.\n\nKaleem Clarkson shows leaders how to design connection on purpose rather than rely on chance. Drawing on research like Buffer’s State of Remote Work survey, where sixty percent of top struggles relate to connection, he explains why friendships, mentoring, and informal networks are now some of the most important drivers of performance and retention.\_\n\nHis keynotes blend stories from a decade of helping companies improve their remote employee experience with practical tools teams can start using the moment the event ends."
