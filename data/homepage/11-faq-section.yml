faq_items:
  - question: 'Do your pricing estimates include travel costs? '
    answer: No. Our estimates do not include the cost of travel. Travel costs are billed at the actual expense. For in-person engagements, we typically book business-class airfare, travel to and from airport, and standard accommodations close to your venue.
  - question: What happens if I need to book on short notice?
    answer: Events scheduled within 30 days are subject to a 25% rush fee based on availability. We recommend booking at least 6-8 weeks in advance to ensure your preferred date and allow adequate time for custom content development.
  - question: How is pricing determined?
    answer: Final investment depends on format, audience size, customization level, and preparation requirements. Pricing starts from $3,500 for panel participation. We offer volume discounts—save 15% when booking three or more sessions.
  - question: What are the payment terms?
    answer: 50% is due at contract signing to secure your date, with the remaining 50% due after event completion. We prefer electronic payment such as wire transfers, and major credit cards. Corporate checks and purchase orders are welcome.
