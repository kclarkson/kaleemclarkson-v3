            <p class="lead">
              For years, offices were treated as a shortcut for culture. Put everyone in the same building and relationships would take care of themselves. Remote work removed that shortcut and exposed a hard truth. Most organizations never had a real social connection strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kaleem Clarkson shows leaders how to design connection on purpose rather than rely on chance. Drawing on research about remote work struggles and loneliness, he explains why friendships, mentoring, and informal networks are now some of the most important drivers of performance and retention.
            </p>
            <p>
              His keynotes blend stories from a decade of helping companies improve their remote employee experience with practical tools teams can start using the moment the event ends.
